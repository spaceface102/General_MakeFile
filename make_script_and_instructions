#the reason to do this is so my directories don't
#get bloated by having a huge makefile every single time
#I want to compile anything, and also
#whenever going inside a project, I know that I will
#be using the same core Makefile from MAKEFILE_DIR
#and therefore projects can be more uniform

#basic steps to use in a git repo
#1. Copy the General Makefile to the repo (base directory)
#2. Copy this file to anywhere you want to a compile a project
#	i. make sure you have a relative path to the Makefile
#	from the building directory (do this to be able to
#	clone the repo to another system and not have to modify
#	anything)
#3. ./make
#4 profit!
#	i. ofcourse you can use ./make clean or ./make -j6

#NOTE: if SRCSDIR or HDRSDIR is just the current directory
#use SRCSDIR=$(pwd) or HDRSDIR=$(pwd)
